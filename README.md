## üëª Legacy version

Version 4 introduces completely breaking changes on both API and technique architecture:
v4 is based on Angular, RxJS and Web Component API, while v3 was based on React and MobX.

While v3 is actually a crude and less functional version, if you need references of the v3 version, please check out the [v3](https://github.com/rikakomoe/ushio/tree/v3) branch of this repository.
